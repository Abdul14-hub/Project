## Crack Surface Detection Project

This project aims to detect cracks on surfaces using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project involves training a CNN model from scratch as well as leveraging a pre-trained model for efficient crack detection. Additionally, it includes an end-to-end implementation deployed using the Flask framework.

### Introduction

Crack detection on surfaces is a critical task in various fields, including civil engineering, infrastructure maintenance, and safety inspection. This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to automatically detect cracks on surfaces from images.

### Features

    * Utilizes CNNs for crack surface detection.
    * Implements both training a model from scratch and leveraging pre-trained models for crack detection.
    * Provides an end-to-end implementation deployed using Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive crack detection results in real-time.

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crack-surface-detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

        cd crack-surface-detection

3. Install the required dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

To use the crack detection system:

1. Start the Flask application:

        python app.py

2. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.

3. Upload an image containing a surface with potential cracks.

4. Receive real-time crack detection results.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training the models consists of images containing various surfaces with and without cracks. The dataset can be obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection].


### Training

The CNN model can be trained from scratch using the provided dataset. Alternatively, a pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for crack detection. Details on training procedures can be found in the Training directory.


### Pre-trained Model

A pre-trained model is provided in the models/ directory. This model can be directly used for crack detection tasks or fine-tuned with additional data.

### Deployment

The project is deployed using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. The deployment code and configuration files can be found in the deployment/ directory.
